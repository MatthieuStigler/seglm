## Notes
...


## To do

### Short term

* correct mismatch grid/dynprog. DONE
* add third method:  grid with recresid, much faster!
* understand effect of ordering over threshold then use structural break techniques
* rename functions, needs consistency
* see potential of other packages, and other methods (penalized regression)
* push to github
* clean utilities.R some not used anymore

### Further functions:

* `seglm_lm()` "workhorse" function. IN PROGRESS
* add function `regime()` IN PROGRESS
* `predict()`: option to feed raw data, transform then
* broom/tidy implementation: 
    - `augment()`: add `regime()`?
    - `tidy()` add threshold
* Hansen `confint()`
* Handle variables with no switch!?
    
## Long term functionalitites to add:

* shrinkage method for threshold
* bootstrap? look at new paradigms...
* Linton Seo (look at `nls()` and partially linear LS literature ) 
* Greb shrinkage stuff. 
* Generalized grid search for `glm()`, or any. Look at Seo JASA paper!
* datasets from Hansen 2000!? https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/progs/ecnmt_00.html
